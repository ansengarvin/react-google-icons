# React Components for Google Icons
All icons are sourced from [Google's Icons]("https://fonts.google.com/icons"). Please view their [Licensing Policy]("https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons#licensing"). I am not affiliated with Google in any way.

Since this repository is largely for personal use, I add icons as I need them. If you would like to see more icons added, feel free to contact me.
